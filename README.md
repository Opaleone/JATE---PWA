# JATE---PWA

## Description
JATE (short for Just Another Text Editor) is an example of a progressive web application that I built using these technologies.

    Node.JS
    Express.JS
    Webpack
    Workbox
    IndexedDB
    Babel

This website can be utilized both in the browser and as a standalone application on your computer and through its service 
worker, can run both online and offline.

## Demo

## Installation

In order to install this application, navigate to the website, https://jate-pwa-lv.herokuapp.com/ and click the button labeled `Install!`. This will install the editor to your machine for use offline and outside of your browser.

## Usage

Using this application is pretty easy. 

When on the website or in the locally hosted application, simply begin typing your code. When you want to save a bit of code that you have written, click anywhere on your screen to unfocus your cursor from the line you are writing. This will save your code to the `IndexedDB` through your browser for later retrieval.
